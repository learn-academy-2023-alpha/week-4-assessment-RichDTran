# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:Object-oriented programming is when coding is bases its foundations on coding around the object to make fuctional code. Such as creating a a method and bringing in object to perform in that method. Whereas fuctional programming is the process of producing code to have a specific behavior or perform a certain task. An example is creating a function and passing through arguments or data to perform the behavior or task it has been created for, like removing odd numbers in array where the array is the data inputted into a function and produces only even numbers.

Researched answer: Object Oriented Programming are classes and objects. It is structured for simple reusable code. This is a good style of coding because it is can be dynamically used such as coding for movies: run time, title, year made. This code would be able to produce over all movies rather than being restricted to one. The four building blocks are Classes, Objects, Methods and Attributes.

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:In Red Robin Ruby a Float and Integer are similar in the aspects of them both being numerical data and where they differ is Float will produce a decimal value and an Integer will give a a whole value with NO decimals.

Researched answer:A float is a number or a representation number for irrationial numbers and creates a decimal point. The inter is the opposit of float and does not have a fractional part and is a whole number.

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:Ruby does not have a "return" so instead it has implicit return which will always produce the last line of method and its value. An auto return of last value.

Researched answer: Implicit return of a Ruby method is the final statement in the method. Which Ruby makes the developers work easier by doing this if we want to know how our Ruby method works.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:Block is the code between the def and end.  The body of the logic being produced. For example: def=start of the method, end= end of the method and *=area of block

def
*       
*
*
end

Researched answer: A block is an anonymous piece of code. Blocks can accept arguments and return values like a function in javascript. Block is always enclosed with curly braces {}. It is invoked by the same name from the functions which means you have to test then use the function test to invoke the block.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:You can extract a value in Ruby hash by assigning a key and value and with .new. .new will register the program so when called upon can be used in whichever block or function and be processed through.

Researched answer: Hash is a data structure used to store data in the form of Unique key value pairs.  Hash can be invoked by => being inclosed with curly braces.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance:
Class inheritance is when  another class retrieves a behaivor from another class. One will be the parent class and the other a child class. Parent class would become "superclass" which will be the main classwhere all the child classes will retrieve the original behaivor.
2. RSpec:
Rspec is a testing tool for Ruby. Very similar to javascript's yarn jest.
3. CRUD:
Stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete which are storage applications to keep data even when system goes down. 
4. Test-driven development:
Test-driven development coincies with Rspec. We as developers will test how coding works if it will pass or not.
5. HTTP:
An easy to use client library in Ruby requests.
